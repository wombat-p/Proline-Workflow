# Update
This project and workflow has been merged into the WOMBAT pipelines.

# Workflows to analyze label-free data with SearchGUI and Proline

## Content

_Nextflow folder:_ Implementation of workflow

_Results folder:_ Output from running the UPS data set


The provided workflow is based on the docker image wombatp/proline-pipeline that is automatically downloaded.

You can also create the image by the following command:
```
# main.nf workflow image creation from the Nextflow folder
docker build -t "wombat/proline-pipeline:dev" .

```

## Getting started

Here is a little script that can be used to test the workflow execution.
This script assumes that Docker is available on your system and is targeting Debian/Ubuntu linux distributions.

```
# Install Java
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk

# Fix docker permission issue (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48957195/how-to-fix-docker-got-permission-denied-issue)
# Note: this allows to run docker as non-root user
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker

# Fetch scripts and data
git clone https://github.com/wombat-p/Proline-Workflow.git
cd ./Proline-Workflow/Nextflow/data
wget ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2015/12/PXD001819/UPS1_500amol_R1.raw

# Nextflow
cd ..
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash

# Worfklow
./nextflow run main.nf -profile docker,test
```

## Run benchmarking data set

You should have successfully tested the workflow using the procedure above.

Download the raw files from PRIDE: http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001819

Run the workflow with the following command and parameters after changing _RAWFOLDER_ to the folder where the raw files are located. You will also need to adjust the paths to _pxd001819.txt_, _yeast_UPS.fasta_ and _lfq_param_file.txt_. These files are given in the _data_ folder of this workflow: https://github.com/wombat-p/Proline-Workflow/tree/dev/data

Also adjust the parameter values _max_cpus_ and _max_memory_ to the computing power you have available.
When running all files, Proline will need at least 16GB.

```
nextflow run main.nf --raws 'RAWFOLDER/*.raw' --fasta '../data/yeast_UPS.fasta' --precursor_mass_tolerance 5 \
  --fragment_mass_tolerance 0.8 --miscleavages 2 --variable_mods 'Oxidation of M, Acetylation of protein N-term' \
  --experiment_design '../data/pxd001819.txt' --lfq_param '../data/lfq_param_file.txt' \
  --max_cpus 8 --max_memory 16GB -profile docker -with-report -with-trace -with-timeline
```
